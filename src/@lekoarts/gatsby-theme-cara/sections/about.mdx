## Why

We are on a mission to save coral reefs by building a digital community of people and projects working in coral restoration.

We believe that a network gives power to the community in a number of ways, mainly to:
- Build alliances for funding and research
- Share knowledge and techniques
- Identify gaps in region or practice
- Connect experienced citizen 'marine' scientists with projects

...giving everyone more time to spend in active restoration.
