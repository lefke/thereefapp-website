  We are developing a comprehensive and searchable collection of projects and organisations working in coral and reef restoration. Allowing projects & organisations to manage profiles, the restoration techniques being applied, display collaborative connections and map their work to specific reefs.

  Similarly to mapping projects, both scientists and citizen 'marine' scientists will be able to create profiles which show which projects they are connected with and their restoration skills and training, allowing for the opportunity to work with projects, connect or seek further training.

  We are planning a collection of mobile apps to support field work and in field logging, allowing citizen 'marine' scientists and small projects to log observations and data in scientifically accepted formats.
