  We are developing a comprehensive and searchable collection of projects and organisations working in coral and reef restoration. Allowing projects & organisations to manage profiles, restoration techniques being applied, collaborative connections and map their work to specific reef regions.

  Similarly to mapping projects, both scientists and citizen 'marine' scientists will be able to create profiles which show the projects they are connected with and their restoration skills and training. Both projects and people combined allow for new collaborations, connections and training opportunities.
